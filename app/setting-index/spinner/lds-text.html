		BEGIN: App-Loading Screen.
		--
		Until the AngularJS application code is loaded and bootstrapped, this is just
		"static HTML." Meaning, the [class-based] directive, "mAppLoading", won't
		actually do anything until the application is initialized. As such, we'll give
		it just enough CSS to "fail open"; then, when the AngularJS app loads, the
		directive will run and we'll remove this loading screen.
		NOTES ON ANIMATION:
		When the AngularJS application is loaded and starts bootstrapping, all
		animations are disabled until all the routing information and templating
		information is loaded AND at least two digests have run (in order to prevent
		a flurry of animation activity). As such, we can't animate the root of the
		directive. Instead, we have to add "ngAnimateChildren" to the root element
		and then animate the inner container. The "ngAnimateChildren" directive allows
		us to override the animation-blocking within the bounds of our directive, which
		is fine since it only runs once.
